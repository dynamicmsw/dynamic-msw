# Dynamic MSW

This project is ready for proof of concepts. The API is gonna be stable. There's an [example](./examples/next) on how to use it with Next.js.
There's also an example on how to add dynamic mocks: [createMock example](./libs/mock-example/src/lib/mock-example.ts)
Docs are still to be made but you could use the examples to get an idea of the API.
It might still contain some bugs so use at your own risk.

## Setup

1. `yarn add @dynamic-msw/core @dynamic-msw/dashboard -D` or
   `npm i @dynamic-msw/core @dynamic-msw/dashboard -D`
2. `yarn setupMockServer ./PATH_TO_PUBLIC_FOLDER/mock-server`
   `npx setupMockServer ./PATH_TO_PUBLIC_FOLDER/mock-server`

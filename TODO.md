# TODOS

1. Allow to disable mocks by default. Allow to disable/enable mocks in the dashboard.
   In a scenario mocks should be enabled unless specified otherwise. Reconsider though.
1. add package.json example for open-app-page implementation and consider exposing it as a .bin script
1. ensure mock titles are uniques or show a warning
1. add automated tests for createScenario (dashboard and core)
1. implement getPageUrl function for scenarios
1. add docs
1. extract the open-app-page module to seperate project
1. dashboar-e2e tests log a lot of assets with the dev vite storybook. Perhaps this can be filtered.

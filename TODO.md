# TODOS

1. types: refactor namings and cleanup and export more. (createMock args are important type defs)
1. add redirect to 404 page for production environments when accessing the dashboard.
1. Add option to hide/disable mocks by default. Usefull for when one only wants to display/use it in an scenario. Reconsider.
1. scan for project todos and filter important ones out
1. add more tests

# TODOS after releasing a stable/well tested version

1. refine and add examples for more frameworks
1. remove selectedValue from mockOptions type
1. extract the open-app-page module to seperate project

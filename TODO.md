# TODOS

1. add docs
1. add package.json example for open-app-page implementation and consider exposing it as a .bin script
1. add more tests
1. extract the open-app-page module to seperate project
1. dashboar-e2e tests log a lot of assets with the dev vite storybook. Perhaps this can be filtered.
1. Allow to disable mocks by default. Allow to disable/enable mocks in the dashboard.
   In a scenario mocks should be enabled unless specified otherwise. Reconsider though.

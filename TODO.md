# TODOS

1. setup proper config for npm data like github repo
1. tired so test publishing tomorrow (feels like lerna publishing is more stable as the nx semver module. Test how lerna behaves in an nx project)
1. see if we can remove the postinstall build script
1. decide if we need to add open-app-page to nextjs for testing/example purposes (would require a post install build probably)

# TODOS

1. Add combineMocks helper so a user can re-use mocks in different scenarios.
   A user should be able to have the same endpoint mocked/defined multiple times but used in different scenarios.
   Add a bootstrap scenario button which will make identical mocks in different scenarios inactive.
1. Allow to disable mocks by default. Allow to disable/enable mocks in the dashboard.
   In a scenario mocks should be enabled unless specified otherwise.
1. Add reset button to dashboard
